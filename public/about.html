<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a scientist turned web designer, intrigued by the unknown and therefore I never stop learning new things. 
  I am a mother of two in search of flexibility in my career to be able to spend time with my kids. I offer services 
  in web hosting and design.
</p>

<p>I am new to this field. What I lack in experience, I make up for in dedication. I am ready and willing to cater 
  to all your web based needs. Lets grow together.
